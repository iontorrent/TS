			<h4>About Torrent Variant Caller (TVC)</h4>
			<p>TVC analyzes mapped reads covering each individual reference base to deduce whether there is sufficient statistical evidence to support calling a SNP, INDEL or MNP at a given position. The analysis can be restricted to a subset of the genome by defining targeted regions. If hotspot regions are defined, TVC includes their positions in the report, even if variants have not been specifically identified.</p>
