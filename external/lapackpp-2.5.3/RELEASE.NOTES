   LAPACK++ V2
-----------------------

2004-12-16 Version 2.1.0
------------------------

Some matrix norms have been added in this release, and much of the
documentation has been updated. Singular value calculation has been
fixed. The '++' in filenames has been removed, but wrapper files with
the old name for backward-compatibility are still included.

2004-07-21 Version 2.0.0
------------------------

This release includes code cleanup for GCC3.4 compilers. Due to the
stability of the library, we now switched to version number two. Some
functions for Singular Value Decomposition have been added.


2004-02-24 Version 1.9.3
------------------------

Some LaLinearSolve function arguments have been made const in
accordance to the actual behaviour. The documentation has been greatly
updated.


2004-02-06 Version 1.9.1
------------------------

Documentation has been greatly updated. Unexpected
LaGenMatDouble::operator=() behaviour has been fixed.


2004-02-04 Version 1.9.0
------------------------

Complex matrices are available again, through the help of the
additional class LaComplex (la::complex<double>) which contains the
necessary conversion functions.


Original release notes for Lapack++ v. 1.1a below:


WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.1.a
---------------------------

Version 1.1a is a bug-fix release, reflecting changes
C++ compiler support:


o) removed generic.h dependencies (used in early C++ compilers)
o) changed X::X(&X) constructor to X::X(const &X) in utgmd.h,
		ltgmd.h, ultgmd.h, uutmgd.h, 
o) reordered members in several matrix objects to coincide with
	constructor argument ordering.
o) removed unused variables (generated warnings on
		some compilers)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------

1) Edit makefile.def to provide system-dependent information,
	mainly the name of the C++ compiler and location of BLAS
	and LAPACK libraires.
	
2) type "make libs" to create Lapack++ libraries:

	o) blaspp.a					BLAS wrappers
	o) liblamatrix++.a			Vector/Matrix classes
	o) liblapack++.a			LAPACK wrappers
	

3) libraires are created in top-level directory of package.
