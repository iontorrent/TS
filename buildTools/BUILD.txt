EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

These fall into two general categories. Those which are included 
in the external folder and those which are assumed to be already
installed on the system. For the external software, browse the
folder labelled external. For system installed dependencies
you will need to install the following Ubuntu packages:

* build-essential
* cmake
* liblapack-dev
* liblapack3gf
* libblas-dev
* libblas3gf
* libatlas-base-dev
* libatlas-headers
* gfortran
* zlib1g-dev
* libcurl4-openssl-dev



BUILD EVERYTHING

From the top level folder (where buildTools, Analysis, and others 
are listed as subfolders) run:

   ./buildTools/build.sh

This will create a build folder "build" which will contain the
compiled object files, executables, and Debian packages. Under
the hood we are using cmake to generate a makefile based build
system. We then run make to do the build. Finally cpack (part
of cmake) is used to generate the packages. 

BUILD SPECIFIC MODULES

From the top level folder (where buildTools, Analysis, and others 
are listed as subfolders) run:

   MODULES="FOO BAR" ./buildTools/build.sh

where FOO and BAR are particular modules to build. 
(eg Analysis). 

BUILD TORRENTR MODULE

A number of R library modules need to be installed in order for the torrentR module to compile.

Add to /etc/apt/sources.list:
deb http://updates.iontorrent.com/updates/software trusty/

Then execute the following:
apt-get update
apt-get install r-base

The following R library modules are required to be installed:

bitops_1.0-5.tar.gz
Rcpp_0.12.1.tar.gz
spam_0.29-3.tar.gz
maps_2.3-3.tar.gz
fields_6.8.tar.gz
RCurl_1.95-4.1.tar.gz
rjson_0.2.12.tar.gz

Here is a bash script which will download and install the required R library modules:
############################################################
# Start of bash script
#
#!/bin/bash
LIBLIST=(\
    bitops_1.0-5.tar.gz \
    Rcpp_0.12.1.tar.gz \
    spam_0.29-3.tar.gz \
    maps_2.3-3.tar.gz \
    fields_6.8.tar.gz \
    RCurl_1.95-4.1.tar.gz \
    rjson_0.2.12.tar.gz \
)

for LIB in ${LIBLIST[@]}; do

    LIBNAME=${LIB%_*}
    DIR=/usr/local/lib/R/site-library
    if ! wget -P /tmp http://updates.iontorrent.com/plugins/$LIB > /tmp/install_$LIBNAME.log 2>&1; then
        #double fail. abort
        echo "Failed to locate source for $LIB file. See tmp/install_$LIBNAME.log"
        exit 1
    fi
    if ! R CMD INSTALL /tmp/$LIB > /tmp/install_$LIBNAME.log 2>&1; then
        echo "Error during install: see /tmp/install_${LIBNAME}.log"
        exit 1
    fi
done

WORK ON SINGLE MODULE

You can create a out-of-tree build folder for your module of 
interest.  eg:

    cd Analysis && mkdir build
    cd build && cmake ..

Or run the build.sh script described in this doc which will create
a top level build folder. eg:

   MODULES="Analysis" ./buildTools/build.sh
   cd build/Analysis

From there you can use the following targets:

   'make': build binaries
   'make package': build debian package

TIPS

* Use VERBOSE=1 when running make to get more info about specific
  commands run. eg:

    VERBOSE=1 make

* To generate makefile system using wizard mode:

    cmake -i ..
	
# Generate official build

	./buildTools/build.sh -DBUILDTAG=TSRC

* Generate debug build

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..    
    - or -
    ./buildTools/build.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

* Some mods to CMakeLists.txt file will not get correctly picked
  up if you are just running "make". In such cases, the simplest
  solution is to blow away the build folder and re-run the build. 
  For example:
   
    rm -r build
    ./buildTools/build.sh

* 'make clean' will clean out the build folder as well as the 
  external libraries. So in general you probably do not want
  to do this. Instead just blow away the build folder as
  described above. 

* Build using shared libraries rather than static 
  [not tested/supported]

    ./buildTools/build.sh -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=TRUE

* Direct install from build folder 
  [not tested/supported]

    sudo make install
    sudo ./debian/postinst configure
