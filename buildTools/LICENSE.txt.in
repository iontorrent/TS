  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
-------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.


                                                                      
6. Disclaimer of Warranty                                    
-------------------------------------------------------------                          
                                                                  
Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk
as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should
any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

                                                         
7. Limitation of Liability                                          
-------------------------------------------------------------                                          

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
                                 
                                                                      
8. Litigation
-------------------------------------------------------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
-------------------------------------------------------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
-------------------------------------------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)

Important Notice READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and associated documentation ("Software"), is the Agreement which governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download the SOFTWARE. Recitals Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE only. 

1.1. Definitions

   1.1.1. Licensee "You", or "Your" shall mean the entity or individual that downloads and uses the SOFTWARE. 
   
   1.1.2. Redistributable Software "Redistributable Software" shall mean the redistributable libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement. 
   
   1.1.3. Software "SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to this Agreement. SOFTWARE may be provided in either source or binary form, at NVIDIA's discretion. 

1.2. Grant of License 

   1.2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable Software in Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3 of this Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE -- and, if the SOFTWARE is provided in source form, to compile the SOFTWARE -- with the following limitations: 
   
   1.2.1.1. Redistribution Rights Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a) the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a component of Licensee's own software products (each, a "Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c) Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap agreement to the license terms under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less restrictive than this Agreement. 
   
   1.2.1.2. Usage Rights Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers, and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Licensee's use within Licensee's Enterprise.

   1.2.1.3. Further Redistribution Rights Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee may authorize Customers to further redistribute the Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided, however, that Licensee shall require in their standard software license agreements with Customers that all such redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to Customers under Section 1.2.1.1.
   
   1.2.1.4. Linux/FreeBSD Exception Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 1.2.1.2, Section 1.2.1.1 and Section 1.2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files). 
   
   1.2.1.5. Additional Licensing Obligations Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement. 
   
   1.2.1.6.

The term of this Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal terms after the Initial Term, unless either party provides to the other party at least three (3) months prior written notice of termination before the end of the applicable renewal term. This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Licensee must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts. Defensive Suspension If Licensee commences or participates in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided under this Agreement during the pendency of such legal proceedings.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds 
of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to 
make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use 
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other 
work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies 
of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can 
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking 
you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute 
copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of 
others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you 
must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure 
that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms 
so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
    
	(1) assert copyright on the software, and 
    (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that 
modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed 
erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the 
software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally 
incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The 
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, 
which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version 
of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially 
in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future 
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not 
allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, 
but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free 
program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as 
semiconductor masks.
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each 
licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or 
organizations.
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion 
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting 
work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier 
work.
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would 
make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, 
except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes 
copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and 
in some countries other activities as well.
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or 
receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer 
of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it 
includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate 
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to 
the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this 
License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user 
commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a 
recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular 
programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that 
language.
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a 
whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but 
which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work 
with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in 
this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of 
the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler 
used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code 
needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to 
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not 
include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free 
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part 
of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files 
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and 
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other 
parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the 
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License 
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output 
from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or 
other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without 
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered 
works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for 
you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply 
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control 
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so 
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them 
from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated 
below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty 
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of 
such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights 
under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to 
limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any 
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-
permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices 
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with 
the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from 
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving 
a relevant date. 
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this 
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the 
requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices". 
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who 
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license 
the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it. 
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal 
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display 
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. 
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are 
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it 
such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is 
called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit 
the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works 
permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply 
to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the 
terms of this License, in one of these ways:
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed 
on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. 
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least 
three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for 
that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a 
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is 
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for 
software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically 
performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding 
Source from a network server at no charge. 
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to 
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally 
and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, 
in accord with subsection 6b. 
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or 
for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same 
way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients 
to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy 
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a 
different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent 
copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code 
saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts 
the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as 
long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 
   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform 
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are 
being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. 
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object 
code work.
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal 
property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) 
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a 
product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For 
a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or 
common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of 
the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the 
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has 
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the 
only significant mode of use of the product.
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions 
of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding 
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the 
modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, 
a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of 
possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source 
conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But 
this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to 
install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to 
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been 
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been 
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself 
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with 
this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation 
available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key 
for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making 
exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable 
to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the 
extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to 
part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the 
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional 
permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any 
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions 
may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) 
You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for 
which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered 
work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the 
terms of this License with terms:
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 
15 and 16 of this License; or 
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author 
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by 
works containing it; or 
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that 
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different 
from the original version; or 
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the 
material; or 
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
trademarks, or service marks; or 
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone 
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual 
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual 
assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. 
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the 
meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a 
notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction 
but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work 
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further 
restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the 
relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a 
notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately 
written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under 
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses 
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular 
copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder 
explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder 
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the 
cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the 
copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first 
time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that 
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties 
who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been 
terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for 
the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the 
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of 
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. 
However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify 
any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from 
the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If 
propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that 
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work 
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a 
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in 
interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or 
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or 
other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate 
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent 
claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or 
any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the 
Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the 
contributor's "contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the 
contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by 
some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor 
version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" 
includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements 
of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and 
otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" 
such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to 
enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the 
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and 
under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other 
readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be 
so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this 
particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this 
License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" 
means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, 
would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to 
believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or 
propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to 
some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, 
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant 
is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, 
prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the 
rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered 
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of 
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the 
extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to 
any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent 
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies 
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or 
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or 
that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or 
other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable 
patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of 
this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to 
collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the 
only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely 
from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or 
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero 
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. 
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but 
the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, 
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the 
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a 
certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" 
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that 
numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If 
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you 
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU 
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a 
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no 
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your 
choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT 
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE 
THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM 
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given 
local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most 
closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the 
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program 
in return for a fee.

GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

    The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

    Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

    This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

    However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

    When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

    If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

    Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

    You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

    For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

2.  GNU General Public License version 2 (GPL v2)  
=====================================================================

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991 
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY BY STATE,
COUNTRY OR OTHER JURISDICTION.

CONFIDENTIALITY

You agree to protect Life Technologies Confidential Information with the
same degree of care used to protect your own confidential information
(but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care), and not to
use or disclose any portion of such Confidential Information to third
parties, except as expressly authorized in this Agreement. You
acknowledge that the Software, including its content, structure,

demonstrate by credible evidence: (a) is, as of the time of its
disclosure, or thereafter becomes part of the public domain through no
fault of yours; (b) was rightfully known to you prior to the time of its
disclosure, or to have been independently developed by you without use
of Confidential Information; and/or (c) is subsequently learned from a
third party not under a confidentiality obligation with respect to such
Confidential Information. Confidential Information that is required to
be disclosed by you pursuant to a duly authorized subpoena, court order,
or government authority shall continue to be Confidential Information
for all other purposes and you agree, prior to disclosing pursuant to a
subpoena, court order, or government authority, to provide prompt
written notice and assistance to Life Technologies prior to such
disclosure, so that Life Technologies may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy to protect against disclosure.

SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENTS

You acknowledge and agree that any ideas, enhancements, modifications,
and the like disclosed by you to Life Technologies with respect to the
Software ("Software Improvements and Feedback") will be the property of
Life Technologies. You agree to assign, and hereby assign, all right,
title, and interest worldwide in the Software Improvements and Feedback

agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or
understandings, whether oral or written. If any provision of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to
law, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect. The controlling language of this Agreement, and any
proceedings relating to this Agreement, shall be English. You agree to
bear any and all costs of translation, if necessary. The headings to the
sections of this Agreement are used for convenience only and shall have
no substantive meaning. All questions concerning this Agreement shall be

    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
    addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
    the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may

    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
    in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the
above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS

any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in

Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such

TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER
OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,

**AND**

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

**1. DEFINITIONS**

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i)changes to the Program, and

ii)additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of
the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

**2. GRANT OF RIGHTS**

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.

**3. REQUIREMENTS**

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

**4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION**

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

**5. NO WARRANTY**

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

**6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY**

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**7. GENERAL**

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under
this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Public Domain Dedication
========================

The persons who have associated their work with this project (the
"Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils
project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less
the [exceptions](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/COPYING.html#exceptions) listed
below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified below
(the "Work") to the public domain.

The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web site
&lt;<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>&gt;. The Work consists of the
files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project Subversion
repository (Internet host docutils.svn.sourceforge.net, filesystem path
/svnroot/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at
&lt;<http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/>&gt;. Files
dedicated to the public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near
the beginning of each file, of a declaration of the form:

Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been placed in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large
and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator
intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in
perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law, whether
vested or contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such
relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights
to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial
or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not
yet been invented or conceived.
