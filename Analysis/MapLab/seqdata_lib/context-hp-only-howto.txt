Seems like I figured out an algorithm to implement hp-only gap cost reduction, with complexity same as SW. The modifications to the current "context" algorithm are:

1) additional attribute to the sequence position is added, the distance from last prior HP start to the position (HPExt, 0 for first occurrence of current base)
2) additional rolling column computed while evaluation DP matrix, the weight of the path ending at previous H position with HP-only gap on the H axis
3) two additional costs are compared (together with original five): for path ending at CP with H and V HP-only gaps. These costs are computed using the HPLen attributes at current H and V axis positions, using same formula as in 'context'. (These attributes are already present in the 'context' algorithm)
4) two a,ditional values added to 'stored direction' enumeration: VerHPgap and HorHPgap. They are stored when corresponding costs (above) are below others
5) while tracing back the path, when the VerHPgap or HorHPgap values are seen, the path is extended by the HPExt value from corresponding axis

The algorithm seem to be correct and robust while the gap function meets reasonable assumptions (it is positive, monotonous, and HP gap cost is below non-HP gap cost for same length gap)
